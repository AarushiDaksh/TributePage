                Iron Lady Of India
            </h1>
            <p>
                ☛ Indira Gandhi, in full Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi, née Nehru, (born November 19,
                 1917, Allahabad, India—died October 31, 1984, New Delhi),
                  Indian politician who was the first female prime minister of India,
                  serving for three consecutive terms (1966–77) and a fourth term from 1980 until 
                she was assassinated in 1984.<br><br>
                ☛ Indira Nehru was the only child of Jawaharlal Nehru, who was one of 
                the chief figures in India’s struggle to achieve independence from Britain, 
                was a top leader of the powerful and long-dominant Indian National Congress (Congress Party),
                 and was the first prime minister (1947–64) of independent India.<br><br>
                ☛Her grandfather Motilal Nehru was one of the pioneers of the independence 
                movement and was a close associate of Mohandas (“Mahatma”) Gandhi. She attended, for one year each, 
                Visva-Bharati University in Shantiniketan (now in Bolpur, West Bengal state) and then the University 
                of Oxford in England.<br><br>
                ☛ She joined the Congress Party in 1938.
                <br><br> ☛ In 1942 she married Feroze Gandhi (died 1960),
                 a fellow member of the party. The couple had two children, Sanjay and Rajiv. However, 
                 the two parents were estranged from each other for much of their marriage.”</strong>
                <br><br> ☛ Indira’s mother had died in the mid-1930s, and thereafter she often acted as her father’s 
                hostess for events and accompanied him on his travels.
                <br><br> ☛ The Congress Party came to power when her father took office in 1947, and Gandhi became a member 
                of its working committee in 1955. In 1959 she was elected to the largely honorary post of party president.
                <br><br> ☛ She was made a member of the Rajya Sabha (upper chamber of the Indian parliament) in 1964, and 
                that year Lal Bahadur Shastri—who 
                had succeeded Nehru as prime minister—named her minister of information and broadcasting in his government.
                <br><br> ☛ On Shastri’s sudden death in January 1966, Gandhi was named leader of the Congress Party—and thus also became prime minister—in a compromise between the party’s right and left wings.
                <br><br> ☛  Her leadership, however, came under continual challenge from the right wing of the party, led by former minister of finance Morarji Desai. She won a seat in the 1967 elections to the Lok Sabha (lower chamber of the Indian parliament), but the Congress Party managed to win only a slim majority of seats, and Gandhi had to accept Desai as deputy prime minister.
                <br><br> ☛Tensions grew within the party, however, and in 1969 she was expelled from it by Desai and other members of the old guard. Undaunted, Gandhi, joined by a majority of party members, formed a new faction around her called the “New” Congress Party.
                <br><br> ☛ In the 1971 Lok Sabha elections the New Congress group won a sweeping electoral victory over a coalition of conservative parties. Gandhi strongly supported East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in its secessionist conflict with Pakistan in late 1971, and India’s armed forces achieved a swift and decisive victory over Pakistan that led to the creation of Bangladesh. She became the first government leader to recognize the new country.
                <br><br> ☛ Public opposition to Gandhi’s two years of emergency rule was vehement and widespread, and after it ended in early 1977, the released political rivals were determined to oust her and the New Congress Party from power. 
                <br><br> ☛ In early 1978 Gandhi and her supporters completed the split from the Congress Party by forming the Congress (I) Party—the “I” signifying Indira.
                <br><br> ☛ Sanjay Gandhi’s death in an airplane crash in June 1980 eliminated Indira’s chosen successor from the political leadership of India. After Sanjay’s death, Indira groomed her other son, Rajiv, for the leadership of her party.
                <br><br> ☛ During the early 1980s Indira Gandhi was faced with threats to the political integrity of India. Several states sought a larger measure of independence from the central government, and Sikh separatists in Punjab state used violence to assert their demands for an autonomous state. In 1982 a large number of Sikhs, led by Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, occupied and fortified the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) complex at Amritsar, the Sikhs’ holiest shrine. 
                <br><br> ☛ Tensions between the government and the Sikhs escalated, and in June 1984 Gandhi ordered the Indian army to attack and oust the separatists from the complex. Some buildings in the shrine were badly damaged in the fighting, and at least 450 Sikhs were killed (Sikh estimates of the death toll were considerably higher). Five months later Gandhi was killed in her garden in New Delhi in a fusillade of bullets fired by two of her own Sikh bodyguards in revenge for the attack in Amritsar. She was succeeded as prime minister by her son Rajiv, who served until 1989.
